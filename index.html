    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    
    <p style=font-size:100%;">Hello. My name is Shourya Kovvuri and honestly, I do not know what my career goal is. There are many things that interest me, but do not interest me enough to pursue them as a job. I took Computer Science Essentials because my dad is a Network Engineer, and decided to follow his footsteps in engineering. However, this may change sooner or later, and it will allow find my true passion. All I do know is that I want a job that I will be happy with and can support my family with its income. In case Computer Science does end up to be my career, I am taking coding classes and joined the VEX robotics club. Both are fun and interactive, I plan to continue them.</p>

    <h2>Strengths and Personal Qualities</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size:100%;">I am adaptable, persistent, and a team player. I am adaptable because whenever I am presented with a new condition, I find it easy to change my ideas or way of thinking in perspective of the situation. This means I can consider all aspects of a coding language when come face to face with a problem. I am persistent because I always overcome any problem that arises. Sometimes it takes a long time, but I never give up. In coding, I will spend lots of time thinking about how to solve a problem. This also relates to being adaptable, If one solution does not work, then I shift my ideas to try something else no matter how difficult the problem. I am a team player because I am able to work well in a group and make the work more quicker with my contribution. This is good in a coding view since I could help a team member with a question they have, and vice versa.  </p>

    <h2>Important Achievments and Abilities/Work Skills</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size:100%;">It has only been my fist semester, so the things I have accomplished are pretty small. I know my way around the campus, know how all my classes are like, joined the Robotics, Weightlifting, and Helping Hands clubs. Best of all, I am in the Freshman Boys Soccer Team. To me, these have been my biggest accomplishments throughout the first semester. Something that I have learned from my experience is that I cannot be slacking off on homework and studying. Even an hour of extra studying can yield better results. I must set two different times for work and entertainment, and cannot intertwine either of them. I have also learned that it is helpful to learn about new things, as you can have and aquire more knowledge when growing older.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p style="font-size:100%;">Although there are always things I can improve on, I would say that my life is going pretty well. Overall, I am pretty happy. Well, thank you for your time and I hope you are here to see me progress and overcome the rest of my life. </p>

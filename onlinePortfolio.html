    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p style=font-size:100%;">Hello. My name is Shourya Kovvuri and honestly, I do not know what my career goal is. There are many things that interest me, but do not interest me enough to pursue them as a job. I took Computer Science Essentials because my dad is a Network Engineer, and decided to follow his footsteps in engineering. However, this may change sooner or later, and it will allow find my true passion. All I do know is that I want a job that I will be happy with and can support my family with its income. In case Computer Science does end up to be my career, I am taking coding classes and joined the VEX robotics club. Both are fun and interactive, I plan to continue them. </p>

    <p style=font-size:100%;">Some qualities I have are being adaptable, persistent, and a team player. I am adaptable because whenever I am presented with a new condition, I find it easy to change my ideas or way of thinking in perspective of the situation. This means I can consider all aspects of a coding language when come face to face with a problem. I am persistent because I always overcome any problem that arises. Sometimes it takes a long time, but I never give up. In coding, I will spend lots of time thinking about how to solve a problem. This also relates to being adaptable, If one solution does not work, then I shift my ideas to try something else no matter how difficult the problem. I am a team player because I am able to work well in a group and make the work more quicker with my contribution. This is good in a coding view since I could help a team member with a question they have, and vice versa. </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size:100%;"> This first project is 3.2.1, the food ordering program we did in Computer Science Essentials. It was completed on 3/5/24. This program allows the user to order food online. It is for the people who are too lazy to pickup the food from the restaurant, or are in a workspace like an office. This program was made using a dictionary for intial costs, and if/else statements for each food input the user wants. The main change I made to this program is changing the use of the while loops so the user can order more than one food item. I also defined totalCost and supersizeCost variable at the beginning of my code, making it easier to determine final cost and what the supersizing adds to your total. I think this program is a notable project because this is the first time where I had incoporated python concepts(if/else, loops, lists, etc.) and spent a lot of time thinking, debugging and facing challenges. A main challenge I had was not being able to show an error message with a loop when there was already a loop for ordering multiple items. This was an individual project, meaning I was able to exercise all aspects like developing, testing, debugging. Here is the code: </p>

    <p style="font-size:100%;"> This second project is the first robot that I made in the Dublin Robotics Club. I am not sure about the exact date it was fully built, but I know it was over the summer of 2023. I think this is an important project because it was my first step into robotics, self pacing managment, hands-on work, and more. The purpose of this bot is to be able to pick items up, move them, and place them down again. It uses motors, gears, wheels, lego parts, wires, and a pre-coded brain to make. It can be controlled by a controller as the brain already has the code needed to move. </p>
